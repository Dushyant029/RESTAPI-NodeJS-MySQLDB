## Overview ‚òÆÔ∏è
To build a REST API using NodeJS to handle customer data and store it in an SQL database

## Description into üïäÔ∏è
 To create a POST API that accepts JSON input for first name, last name, email, mobile
 number (with country code), address, and pin code. Implement validation for email, mobile
 number, and pin code. Upon receiving a valid request, store the data in a SQL database
 using a stored procedure, with a table named "Customer Details". The table will include f
 ields for a unique Customer ID (auto-generated), first name, last name, email, mobile
 number, address, and pin code. The API will return a success response on successful
 insertion or a failure response if validation fails or the insertion is unsuccessful.
   
## How we built it!?üß†
I used Express.js in the frontend. And have used MySQL for database configuration and to hit the API used Postman platform.

    * POST API that allows customers to register their personal information.
    * API will validate the input data and securely store the customer details in a SQL database.
    * Created API Response Handling.
